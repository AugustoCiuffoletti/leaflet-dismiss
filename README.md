# Step 2: managing map events

The *leaflet* library allows to manage many kinds of events, included those generated by the mouse. The most basic one is the mouse click.

To catch and manage a map event we use the *on* method applied to the map. The method takes as a parameter the catched event, a *click* in our case, and a function, that recevies as a parameter the description of the catched event.

According with a well.established practice, the arrow syntax is used for the function. The function in itself is made of a single alert statement, that displays the coordinates by decomposing the coordinates of the click contained in the event description.

You can try instead to define a marker using that info, with a popup indicating the point coordinates. Also, you can inspect other possible mouse events, and browse the content of the event description using the reference documentation.

Proceed to the next step by selcting the *coordInHTML* branch.

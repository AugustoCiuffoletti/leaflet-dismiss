# Step 4: linking markers and coordinates

A marker has *title* attribute that is displayed when the mouse transits over it, without a click. We can use this information to associate a marker to its coordinates.

To this purpose we define a counter *n* that is incremented each time a new marker is created. The same value is displayed in front of each row in the list of coordinates.

Again, you can improve the visualization using a HTML table.
